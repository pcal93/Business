# üöÄ **URANUS51 - AI-Powered ISO 50001 Certification Solution** üåç

## Project Overview

**URANUS51** is an innovative university project designed for the *Business and Project Management* exam. The project focuses on revolutionizing energy management in industries and households through **AI-powered solutions**. By leveraging **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Neural Networks (NN)**, and a network of **IoT sensors**, URANUS51 automates the process of achieving and maintaining **ISO 50001 certification**, ensuring long-term energy efficiency and sustainability.

The project initially targets **energy-intensive industries**, and as a second phase, it extends the same energy optimization principles to **domestic environments**, helping individuals adopt energy-efficient practices at home.

## üéØ **Objectives**

### 1. **Business Concept**

The goal of URANUS51 is to automate and streamline the process of achieving and maintaining **ISO 50001 certification** for **energy-intensive industries**. Using cutting-edge technologies like AI, Neural Networks, and IoT sensors, we provide businesses with actionable insights for optimizing energy consumption and complying with ISO standards. In phase two, we will expand this technology to help **households** adopt sustainable, energy-efficient practices.

### 2. **Project Planning**

Developing a comprehensive project plan is essential for ensuring the success of the initiative. This phase includes creating timelines, defining roles, and identifying key deliverables for both industrial and domestic sectors. The planning process also includes identifying milestones and tasks necessary for product launch and implementation.

### 3. **Business Model**

We will use the **Business Model Canvas** and other business modeling techniques to define our target market, value proposition, revenue streams, and market strategy. This phase will also involve financial modeling to ensure long-term sustainability.

### 4. **Project Management**

The project will follow **Project Management** principles such as **Gantt charts**, **PERT diagrams**, and **risk management** strategies to track progress, ensure resource optimization, and mitigate risks throughout the development process.
