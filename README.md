# URANUS51 - AI-Powered ISO 50001 Certification Solution

## Project Overview

**URANUS51** is a university project developed for the *Business and Project Management* exam. The project concept revolves around helping energy-intensive industries achieve and maintain **ISO 50001** certification through an AI-powered, automated process. The solution leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Neural Networks (NN)**, and a network of **IoT sensors** to monitor energy consumption from machinery and surrounding environments. This data is then analyzed to provide tailored recommendations for energy optimization, enabling companies to meet ISO 50001 requirements and sustain certification over time.

As a second phase, the project expands its impact by promoting sustainability in **domestic environments**, applying similar AI and sensor-based solutions to help individuals adopt energy-efficient practices in their homes.

## Objectives

* **Business Concept**: The core idea of URANUS51 is to provide energy-intensive industries with an automated, AI-powered solution to help them achieve and maintain **ISO 50001 certification**. The mission is to streamline energy management practices and optimize energy consumption using advanced technologies like AI, Neural Networks, and IoT sensors. The vision is to expand this solution to domestic environments, bringing sustainability and energy efficiency to households.

* **Project Planning**: Develop a detailed project plan including timelines, resources, and deliverables for both the industrial and domestic sectors. This involves defining key milestones, roles, and tasks needed to launch the platform, alongside clear timelines for development and implementation.

* **Business Model**: Using business modeling techniques such as the **Business Model Canvas**, the project will outline the business structure, target market, value proposition, and revenue streams. This includes understanding customer needs, the market demand for ISO 50001 automation, and the financial model needed to sustain the business.

* **Project Management**: Apply **Project Management** principles, such as **Gantt charts**, **risk assessments**, and **resource allocation**, to ensure the business progresses smoothly throughout its phases. This includes the management of resources, scheduling, and monitoring of performance to ensure the project stays on track.

## Technologies & Methodologies

* **Project Management Tools**: Tools like **Gantt charts**, **PERT diagrams**, **Work Breakdown Structures (WBS)**, and project scheduling tools will be used for effective project tracking and management.

* **Business Modeling**: Techniques such as **Business Model Canvas**, **SWOT analysis**, and **financial projections** will define the business structure, market strategy, and financial health of the company.

* **Risk Management**: Identify, analyze, and mitigate potential risks that could affect the project, such as technical challenges, market competition, or resource shortages. Risk management will be a key component of the project planning and monitoring phases.

* **Team Collaboration**: Use collaboration tools like **Trello**, **Slack**, and other project management software to ensure smooth communication and coordination among team members throughout the development and execution phases.

## Key Features

* **AI-Powered Automation**: Utilizes AI and Neural Networks to process real-time data, providing actionable recommendations to meet ISO 50001 certification requirements.
* **Data Collection**: A network of sensors monitors both industrial machinery and environmental factors to track energy consumption and identify areas for improvement.
* **ISO 50001 Compliance**: Streamlined process for helping companies achieve and maintain ISO 50001 certification through automation and continuous improvement.
* **Sustainability Expansion**: A second phase of the project aims to extend energy-efficiency practices into the domestic sphere, making sustainability accessible to individuals and households.
* **Continuous Monitoring & Updates**: Ongoing data analysis and system updates to ensure continued compliance and optimization of energy management practices.

## Phases of the Project

1. **Business Planning**:

   * Conduct **market research**, competitor analysis, and feasibility studies to validate the business concept and ensure demand in the target industries.
2. **Execution Strategy**:

   * Define roles, resources, timelines, and budgets for the **launch phase**. This includes aligning project objectives with key deliverables, ensuring that all team members are onboard and prepared to execute the strategy.
3. **Monitoring & Control**:

   * Set **KPIs** (Key Performance Indicators), evaluate performance, and manage risks throughout the project lifecycle. Constantly monitor project progress and adjust the plan as necessary to ensure timely and successful completion.
4. **Post-launch**:

   * After the project is launched, the focus will shift to **evaluation** of business outcomes, customer feedback, and the ability to adjust the platform or service offering for long-term sustainability and expansion into new markets.
